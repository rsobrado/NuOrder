# NuORDER FE Takehome
application with an autocomplete input box for searching issues for React’s repo (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues)

## Goal
We would like to have an opportunity to learn about your skills. This is an open ended project
where you should put as much effort as you consider right to show what you think is important.
Delivery of Code
Please share a Github repo with your code.

## Task
Using Github’s API (https://developer.github.com/), build an application with an autocomplete
input box for searching issues for React’s repo (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues). Input
and results should be able to navigate via keyboard shortcuts. Each result should have but not
limited to, the issue’s title and labels.

### Installation
run 'npm install
run 'npm start'

#### Pending:
Hooks optimization (use same hook for **issues** and **search bar**
#### Limitations:
Due to github API restriction total of issues is limited(100)
'https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues?per_**page=100**&state=all'
#### Maybe:
CSS improvements
- issue status indicator(open/close)
- add icons and comments for each issue
